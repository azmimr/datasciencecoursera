### List of Module Projects

The purpose of this page is to list the various final projects which I completed for the modules in this specialization. The github repositories are listed first and other products if created, for example a 'standalone' web page, are listed after. A short description is given for each project.

#### The Data Scientists's Toolbox
* No project

#### R Programming
* [Github](https://github.com/azmimr/ProgrammingAssignment2): Write 2 functions to cache the inverse of a matrix. Solution is in **cacheMatrix.R**

#### Getting and Cleaning Data
* [Github](https://github.com/azmimr/Getting_Cleaning_Data_Project): An R script that downloads, processes and saves data (from smart devices).

#### Exploratory Data Analysis
* [Github](https://github.com/azmimr/ExData_Plotting1): The objective is to recreate 4 plots from the data as shown in the README file. The graph are created in the individual R scripts and the output are saved as PNG images.

#### Reproducible Research
* [Github](https://github.com/azmimr/RepData_PeerAssessment1): Project 1 - 
* [Rpubs](http://rpubs.com/azmimr/165777): Project 2:

#### Statistical Inference
* [Github](https://github.com/azmimr/Stat_Inference):

#### Regression Models
