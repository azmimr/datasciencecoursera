### List of Module Projects

The purpose of this page is to list the various final projects which I completed for the modules in this specialization. The github repositories are listed first and other products if created, for example a 'standalone' web page, are listed after. A short description is given for each project.

#### The Data Scientists's Toolbox
* No project

#### R Programming
* [Github](https://github.com/azmimr/ProgrammingAssignment2): Write 2 functions to cache the inverse of a matrix. Solution is in **cacheMatrix.R**

#### Getting and Cleaning Data
* [Github](https://github.com/azmimr/Getting_Cleaning_Data_Project): An R script that downloads, processes and saves data (from smart devices).

#### Exploratory Data Analysis
* [Github](https://github.com/azmimr/ExData_Plotting1): The objective is to recreate 4 plots from the data as shown in the README file. The graph are created in the individual R scripts and the output are saved as PNG images.

#### Reproducible Research
* [Github](https://github.com/azmimr/RepData_PeerAssessment1): Project 1 - Analyze data from activity monitoring devices to answer some questions.
* [Rpubs](http://rpubs.com/azmimr/165777): Project 2 - Analysis of NOAA Storm data.

#### Statistical Inference
* [Github](https://github.com/azmimr/Stat_Inference): The project has 2 parts. Part 1 examines the exponential distribution and comparing it to the Central Limit Theorem. Part 2 examines the effect of Vitamin C on tooth growth in Guinea Pigs.

#### Regression Models
* [Github](https://github.com/azmimr/Regression_Models): Study the relatiopnship between mileage and transmission type using simple and multivariate linear regression.
* [Github Pages](http://azmimr.github.io/Regression_Models/project.html): Web page version of the solution.

#### Practical Machine Learning
* [Github](https://github.com/azmimr/Practical_Machine_Learning_Project ): Using data from activity monitory devices, the project aims to create a model to predict the manner a given set of subjects did their exercise. This project used a decision tree and a random forest algorithms.
* [Github Pages](http://azmimr.github.io/Practical_Machine_Learning_Project/): Web page version of the solution.

#### Developing Data Products
* Completed August 2016
